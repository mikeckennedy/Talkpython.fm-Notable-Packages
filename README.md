# TalkPython['Podcast'] Compilation of Notable PyPI Packages

üëã I love listening [Talk Python To Me Podcast](https://talkpython.fm/), a weekly podcast hosted by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) dedicated to the people and ideas in Python. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps). He has a casual 45 minute conversation with industry experts. At the end of each episode, Michael asks two questions:

1. If you're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?
2. Any notable PyPI (or Conda and sometimes npm) package?

This is a community & unofficial compilation of those amazing Notable PyPI (or Conda) Python Packages highligted at the end of the show.

Don't forget to hit the star ‚≠ê button if you like this project and would love to see updates.

1. **Pyre** - *A performant type checker for Python.* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyre-check/) | [Website](https://pyre-check.org/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check)

Pyre is a performant type checker for Python compliant with [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/). Pyre can analyze codebases with millions of lines of code incrementally ‚Äì providing instantaneous feedback to developers as they write code. You can try it out on examples in the Pyre Playground.

Pyre ships with Pysa, a security focused static analysis tool we've built on top of Pyre that reasons about data flows in Python applications. Please refer to our documentation to get started with our security analysis.

2. **Œºsort** - *A small, safe import sorter.* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/usort/) | [Website](https://usort.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/usort)

Œºsort is a safe, minimal import sorter. Its primary goal is to make no "dangerous" changes to code. This is achieved by detecting distinct "blocks" of imports that are the most likely to be safely interchangeable, and only reordering imports within these blocks without altering formatting. Code style is left as an exercise for linters and formatters.

Within a block, ¬µsort will follow common Python conventions for grouping imports based on source (standard library, third-party, first-party, or relative), and then sorting lexicographically within each group. 


3. **PDM** - *Python Development Master.* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pdm/) | [Website](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) | [Source Code](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm)

PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management tool. It was originally built for personal use. If you feel you are going well with Pipenv or Poetry and don't want to introduce another package manager, just stick to it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools, you can probably find some goodness in pdm.

Spoiler alert, mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards. This package contains a rolling backport of the standard library mock code compatible with Python 3.6 and up. unittest.mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used. unittest.mock provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.

Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. Stevedore avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.

Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include Luigi, Oozie and Azkaban.

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's Xcom feature). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN. You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Just apply one of the Numba decorators to your Python function, and Numba does the rest.

NetworkML is the machine learning portion of our Poseidon project. The model in networkML classifies each device into a functional role via machine learning models trained on features derived from network traffic. "Functional role" refers to the authorized administrative purpose of the device on the network and includes roles such as printer, mail server, and others typically found in an IT environment. Our internal analysis suggests networkML can achieve accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in the high 90's when trained on devices from your own network. Whether this performance can transfer from IT environment to IT environment is an active area of our research. Dear network administrator üèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉ, NetworkML predicts the functional role of network-connected device via network traffic analysis and machine learning.

`Bleac`h is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips markup and attributes. Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters that Django's urlize filter cannot, and optionally setting rel attributes, even on links already in the text. Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources. If you find yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or don't.
